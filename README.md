# Lab: Functional Components

## Part 1: A little review

#### 1. Make your CSS links have space between them so they aren't all clumped together

You can do this any way you'd like. (margin, padding, containers, flexbox, grid, etc.)

#### 2. Choose for 4 colors that you like. Find a hex code or built-in color name for each.

Use the 4 colors from for the following 

* link color
* link hover
* link visited
* link visited hover

#### 3. Remove the underline from the links


## Part 2: Functional Components

HomeContent is a functional component, with a prop that's already been done for you as an example. It is incuded in the Home component, which now serves as a "container" for other components.

#### 1. Change "YOURNAMEHERE" on the Home page to your own name! 

#### 2. Add another functional component on the home page. It should include an image of your choice and a caption. Call this component HomeImage.

You can use placekitten or fillmurray if you don't have an image you'd like to display.

#### 3. Create another functional component for the Home page called HomePitch. It should include some text about yourself and be located below the HomeImage. 

Note: Home component now contains three functional components as children.

#### 4. Create a functional component called ContactDetails

This component should have links the following:

* your email
* your resume
* your linked in
* your github

#### BONUS 1: Find Icons for LinkedIn, Email, Resume, and Github. 

#### BONUS 2: On hover of any icon, have the icon change color with your CSS.
